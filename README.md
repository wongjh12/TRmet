# TRmet algorithm
Algorithm developed to predict in silico Transcriptional Regulator (TR) targets for improved terpenoid production by integrating genome-scale metabolic model and transcriptional regulatory network (TRN). 
Additionally, the algorithm allows to predict medium components resulting in improved yield for both native and engineered strains.
